In order to install and use the geocoder:

- read over and run `install_geocoder.sh` for installation
    - this takes a long time!  you should probably run it line by line
    - run from `~` so that directory is in `~/geocoder/` (else change location of `geocode.rb`)
- the script will symmlink a copy of `geocode.R` to `~`
- run a list of addresses in a CSV file with the command `./geocode.R` 
    - run `./geocode.R` without any args to see instructions
